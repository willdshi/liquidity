MC loops tend to be short, 100 to burn in and 100 to sample

sigma2time (for observation equation) has the sigma for the state that it is in

sfStateGDataAll1 holds state probabilities

The outside loops are the monte carlo runs
Random numbers are drawn from backwards function. 
backwards/forward function have giant loops to calculate the backwards estimation and forward filter 
	for all time periods
	
The HMM specification is:
3 unobserved states
time homogenous - transition matrix is same through time. 
random process in each state is the same (same mean, same variance), through time.
